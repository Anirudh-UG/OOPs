# OOPs: Object Oriented Programming Paradigms in Python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of popular Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms using Python. It is designed as a reference and learning resource for understanding how OOP concepts are applied in Pythonic code.

## Overview

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (methods). This repository provides clear, practical examples of OOP principles in Python.

## Key OOP Concepts

- **Class & Object**: Blueprints and instances
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism to create a new class using details of an existing class
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types)
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts

## Implemented Paradigms

- Classical Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Composition
- Abstract Base Classes
- Interfaces (using ABC module)
- Method Overriding
- Operator Overloading
- Mixins
- Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd oops
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Browse the code examples in the repository. Each paradigm is implemented in a separate Python file with comments and explanations. You can run the examples directly:

```bash
python examples/<example_file>.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or submit pull requests to add new paradigms, improve documentation, or fix bugs.
